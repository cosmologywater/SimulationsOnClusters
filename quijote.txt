## original data
download from website "https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access.html".
path: "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/", in this path, the folder named from 0 to 1999 is the original halo data of quijote simulation nwLH.The files in each folder contain four snapshots, which is shown below:
    000 ——> z=3
    001 ——> z=2
    002 ——> z=1
    003 ——> z=0.5
    004 ——> z=0
The original data can be read via '/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/quijote_documentation/quijote_manager.py', the example file can be found from "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/quijote_documentation/Quijote_LHvw_data_to_cic_field.ipynb"

Infromation of simulation nwLH:
The simulations in this category include massive neutrinos. There is one single latin-hypercube in this category, and it contains 2,000 simulations that vary the value of omega_m,omega_b,h,n_s,sigma_8,M_nu and w.The limits of this latin-hypercube are set by:
    omega_m-->[0.1 , 0.5]
    omega_b-->[0.03 , 0.07]
    h-->      [0.5 , 0.9]
    n_s-->    [0.8 , 1.2]
    sigma_8-->[0.6 , 1.0]
    M_nu-->   [0 , 1]
    w-->      [-1.3, -0.7]
Box_size: 1000Mpc/h
Number of particles: cdm = 512**3, neutrinos = 512**3

cosmological parameters of each simulation can be found: "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/CosmoPara.txt". This file has 2000 groups of cosmologocal parameters which correspond to 2000 original simulations mentioned above.

##point cloud data
After doing operations adding RSD,convert_to_dft_cosmo,cut_min_box(744Mpc/h) and halo mass cut(make sure halo number density = 2e-4) on original data, we obtain point cloud data, which only have 1710 samples, because 290 samples can not reach the threshold value 2e-4 of number density, so they are dropped! The process of generating point cloud data can be found in  "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/quijote_documentation/Quijote_LHvw_data_to_cic_field.ipynb"
These point cloud data which has 1710 samples can be found in "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/point_cloud_2/".
The information of point cloud contains: x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,mass
Parameters: "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/CosmoPara_new.txt"

##cic field data
The example of generating cic field from point cloud data can be found in "/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/quijote_documentation/Quijote_LHvw_data_to_cic_field.ipynb".
The cic field with grid [300,300,300] can be found in '/public1/home/scb4289/projects/minzhw/latin_hypercube_nwLH/cic_field_300/' and also only 1710 simulations included.
